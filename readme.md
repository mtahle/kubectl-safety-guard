# Safety Guard Plugin for Oh My Zsh

## üöß Purpose
A protective Zsh plugin that intercepts Kubernetes CLI commands (`kubectl`) and prevents accidental changes to **production environments**. It detects the active context and prompts for confirmation unless explicitly overridden with a safe flag.

---

## ‚ú® Features
- Detects "prod" environments based on `kubectl config current-context`
- Warns users before executing potentially destructive commands
- Allows bypassing prompts via a custom `--safe-force` flag
- Whitelist of safe subcommands that never trigger warnings
- Configurable via `config.zsh`

---

## üß© Supported Tools (So Far)
- ‚úÖ `kubectl`
- (Planned) `helm`, `argocd`, `aws`

---

## üìÅ Installation

### 1. Clone into your custom plugin directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/mtahle/safety-guard.git ~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/safety-guard
```

### 2. Enable the plugin in your `.zshrc`:
```zsh
plugins=(... safety-guard)
```

### 3. Restart Zsh:
```bash
exec zsh
```

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration
Edit the file: `~/.oh-my-zsh/custom/plugins/safety-guard/config.zsh`

```zsh
# Keywords that flag a context as production\export SAFETY_PROD_KEYWORDS=("prod" "production" "live")

# Subcommands allowed without prompt
export SAFETY_KUBECTL_SAFE_COMMANDS=(
  "get" "describe" "config" "version" "cluster-info" \
  "api-resources" "api-versions" "logs"
)

# Flag to bypass confirmation
export SAFETY_FORCE_FLAG="--safe-force"
```

---

## üí° Usage

Run any `kubectl` command:
```bash
kubectl apply -f my.yaml
```
If you're in a prod cluster, you'll see:
```
‚ö†Ô∏è  You are about to run a command on a PRODUCTION cluster: [prod-cluster]
Are you sure? Type 'yes' to continue:
```

Bypass with:
```bash
kubectl apply -f my.yaml --safe-force
```
